Palette is a toy platformer to test out the Phaser3 APIs, where the player can only interact with coloured items which are the same colour as the player. It is hosted [here](https://athenodoros.github.io/Palette/).

All art is the delightful work of [Kennel.nl](https://kenney.nl/), using the bundle [here](https://opengameart.org/content/platformer-art-complete-pack-often-updated).
